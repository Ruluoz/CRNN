# CRNN-MA
Convolutional-Recurrent Neural Networks with Multiple Attention Mechanisms for Speech Emotion Recognition. We set three strategies for the proposed CRNN-MA: A multiple self-attention layer in the CNN module on frame-level weights, a multi-dimensional attention layer as the input features of the LSTM, and a fusion layer summarizing the features of the two modules. 

# Setup
tensorflow == 1.4  
python == 3.6
